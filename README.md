# Provider Search Application

## About The Project

The Provider Search Application is designed to facilitate the search for healthcare providers, offering detailed information and user reviews to help choose the best care possible. Our application not only allows users to search for physicians based on various criteria but also provides in-depth biographic and geographic information about them.

Key Features:

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for physicians by specialty, location, ratings, and other criteria.
- **Provider Profiles**: Each physician has a detailed profile with biographical information, reviews, and geographic location.
- **Care Center Information**: Discover other providers and staff, including Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and Office Managers, operating out of the same care center.
